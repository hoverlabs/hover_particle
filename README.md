Spark Library for Hover (www.justhover.com)

Hover is a development kit that lets you control your hardware projects in a whole new way.
Wave goodbye to physical buttons. Hover detects hand movements in the air for touch-less interaction.
It also features five touch-sensitive regions for even more options. Hover uses I2C and 2 digital pins. It is compatible with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Spark.
